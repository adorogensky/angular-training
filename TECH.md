# What makes for a good technology
* Performance a.k.a speed of execution, tests included 
* Scope = in how many different environments can this technology be used?
* Simplicity a.k.a ease of use =
  simple concepts;
  comprehensive but comprehensible documentation;
* Integration with IDEs
* Extensibility 
* Adoption in Tech Community
* Open Source Licensing
* Availability and Licensing of tools and Integration Technologies

- complexity: how much does memorization do the technology require, e.g. createComponent signature
- simplicty: less memorization, more deduction
- complexity: confusion, spectator.component vs spectator.fixture.componentInstance
- spectator: can i query angular components from the DOM, e.g. a MatLabel?

- complexity
  - less people who understand the technology
    - lower adoption scalability
    - worse documentation
    - poor performance
    - more defects
    - longer release cycles
    - breaking changes
